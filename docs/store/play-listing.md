# Emberdelve — Google Play listing draft

Draft copy for the Play Console listing (owner to review before submitting).
Screenshots + feature graphic: first pass committed under
`docs/store/screenshots/` (1080×1920 PNGs + 1024×500 graphic, rendered from
real screens via `tool/store_screenshots_test.dart` — rerun any time the UI
changes). Real-device captures can replace them later if preferred (that
session also closes the real-device playthrough gate, features.json M1-3).

## Full description (4000 chars max)

Descend into the delve, one roll at a time.

Emberdelve is a single-player dice roguelite built on one promise: every
death is fair. Enemies always telegraph their next move, dice resolve by
rules you can learn — no hidden modifiers, no rigged near-misses — and every
run is seeded, so the same choices always play out the same way.

BUILD YOUR POOL
Draft, forge, and upgrade a pool of dice — keen edges, warding irons, lucky
charms. Chase pairs, triples, and straights: combos turn a spare d4 into the
best die on the table.

PUSH YOUR LUCK
One risky reroll per turn. Exact kills pay out bonus embers; overkill splashes
to the next foe. Assigning a 4 instead of a 6 is a real decision, every turn.

CHOOSE YOUR PATH
Branching maps with honest reward previews — see what an elite guards before
you commit. Shops, forges, strange events, and a boss waiting at the bottom.

DIE FORWARD
Death banks embers. Spend them on new dice, characters, and ascension tiers.
Pick a starting boon and delve again in seconds — 15 boons keep restarts
fresh.

FAIR BY DESIGN
• Zero ads, zero tracking, no internet permission — fully offline
• No energy timers, no streaks, no FOMO mechanics
• Deterministic runs: fair deaths, learnable rules
• A daily seeded delve, shared by everyone
• Easy, normal, and hard difficulties

Made for one-thumb portrait play. Delve in.
