"""tool/level_author.py — author the campaign levels from a small layout DSL.

Hand-counting columns in a 110-wide ASCII grid is how levels end up with a
hazard under the thumb buttons and an enemy 1.4 s from spawn. This module
places every feature at an explicit tile coordinate instead, then renders the
grid that ships in assets/levels/.

Design rules baked in (from the Apple Knight comparison, docs/ak-parity-plan.md
and the 2026-07-25 playtest):
  * SAFE_RUNWAY tiles of nothing-can-hurt-you after the spawn — AK teaches on
    empty ground before it tests
  * three terrain tiers, so a screen has an over-route and an under-route
    instead of one corridor
  * campfire checkpoints ('K') roughly every third of the level
  * secret chests always behind a cracked wall

Run: python3 tool/level_author.py         (writes assets/levels/w1_*.txt)
